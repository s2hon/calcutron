# jQuery Calculator

## Instructions

* Create the JavaScript logic necessary to add functionality to the jQuery Calculator.

* Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

* You should be making use of the existing buttons.

* You should be making use of the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

* You should have fun and push yourselves! This is a challenge activityâ€”which means, if you get it done, you are a King of jQuery. If you don't, no sweat. The important thing is that you learned at least a FEW things along the way.

1. Begin creating sets of variables (your state) that you think you will need. As a few suggestions:
firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, result
2. Create code that captures the numbers from button clicks, and then displays them on the HTML.
3. Create code that captures an operator click, then immediately tells your code to begin recording the second number. (Example: If a user clicks the "plus" button, you know they are done typing the first number).
4. Create code that checks which operator the user has clicked, then saves this operator for later use in a conditional statement. (Example: If a user clicks the "plus" button, you know you will need to be adding two numbers. If a user clicks the "minus" button, you will need to be subtracting two numbers. Think: if-else statements!)
